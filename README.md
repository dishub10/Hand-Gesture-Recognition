# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

The "Hand Gesture Recognition for Media Player Control" project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to allow users to control a media player through hand gestures. By capturing real-time hand movements using a webcam, the system processes these gestures to interpret commands such as play, pause, volume adjustment, forward, and rewind.
